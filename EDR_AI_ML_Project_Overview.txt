====================
The project consists of several interconnected components:

1. EDR Agent Modules (Real-time Monitoring)
2. Backend Flask Server (Data Collection & Storage)
3. MongoDB Database (Log Storage)
4. AI/ML Pipeline (Threat Detection & Decision Making)
5. Action Executor (Automated Response)

                            AI/ML IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION & FEATURE ENGINEERING
==============================================

What We Did:
- Implemented automated log collection from multiple EDR agent modules
- Created a unified data pipeline that normalizes logs from various sources

- File system monitoring (file changes, downloads, suspicious activities)
- USB device monitoring (device insertion/removal)
- YARA rule scanning results
- Logic bomb detection events
- Process tree analysis
- Autorun registry monitoring

Feature Engineering:
- Categorical features: event_type, module, process names, file extensions
- Numerical features: severity scores, CPU usage, file sizes, entropy values
- Derived features: risk indicators, suspicious IP flags, external connection flags
- Temporal features: timestamps, duration, uptime

PHASE 2: MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEVELOPMENT
==========================================

Algorithms Implemented:
1. Random Forest Classifier (Baseline Model)
   - Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
   - Handles both numerical and categorical features
   - Provides feature importance rankings
   - Robust against overfitting

2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - Sequential ensemble method
   - Builds trees that correct errors from previous trees
   - Excellent performance on structured data
   - Handles imbalanced datasets well

3. Logistic Regression
   - Linear model for classification
   - Provides probability scores
   - Fast inference for real-time applications
   - Good baseline for comparison

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Kernel-based classification
   - Effective for high-dimensional data
   - Configurable kernels (linear, RBF)
   - Good generalization capabilities

Model Training Approach:
- Used 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test split
- Implemented stratified sampling for balanced class distribution
- Applied k-fold cross-validation (5 folds) for robust evaluation
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- Implemented class balancing for imbalanced datasets

PHASE 3: REAL-TIME INFERENCE & DECISION MAKING
==============================================

ML Integration:
- Models are loaded at runtime for real-time predictions
- Each security event is processed through the ML pipeline
- Predictions include threat classification and confidence scores
- Automated decision making based on ML confidence thresholds

Decision Logic:
- High confidence (≥0.8): Automatic blocking/quarantine
- Medium confidence (≥0.4): Generate alerts
- Low confidence (<0.4): Log for monitoring
- Fallback to severity-based decisions when ML is unavailable

                            HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
================================================================================

REAL-TIME MONITORING FLOW:
==========================

1. Event Detection:
   - EDR agent modules continuously monitor system activities
   - Events are captured in real-time (process creation, file changes, network connections)

2. Severity Scoring:
   - Each event is automatically scored using severity_scoring.py
   - Scores range from 1-10 based on risk indicators
   - Multiple factors contribute to final severity (file type, process behavior, network activity)

3. ML Decision Making:
   - Events are processed through the trained ML model
   - Model predicts threat level and provides confidence score
   - Decision logic determines appropriate action (log/alert/block)

4. Automated Response:
   - High-confidence threats trigger automatic actions
   - Process termination for malicious processes
   - File quarantine for suspicious files
   - Network blocking for malicious connections

5. Data Collection:
   - All events (with ML decisions) are sent to MongoDB
   - Data includes: severity, ml_action, ml_confidence, ml_exec
   - Continuous learning from new data for model improvement
