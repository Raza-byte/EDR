or more effectively we could speed up virtual environment or sandbox to do an early trigger for that bomb
Monitor processes that always execute at the same time daily (e.g., 3:00 AM).	

Procedure

Agent detects a script calling time.sleep(2592000) (30 days).

ML engine flags it as anomaly.
EDR quarantines the script, halts its future execution, and alerts SOC.
Analysts investigate â€” they spot a time-based payload and remove it safely.
